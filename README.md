# Robo Poetics - Preface
<p>Welcome to our second volume of Robo Poetics. This is an anthology of computer generated poetry created by the students in the <a href="https://brocku.ca/humanities/digital-humanities/programs/iasc/">Interactive Arts and Science</a> program at <a href="https://brocku.ca/">Brock University</a>. The IASC undergraduate major, housed in the <a href="https://brocku.ca/humanities/digital-humanities/">Centre for Digital Humanities</a>, is a multidisciplinary program that seeks to prepare the next generation of digital media innovators and scholars. Our students work to better understand the social and cultural consequences of technology, while also developing the technical capabilities needed to shape our shared digital future.</p>

<p>In our second iteration of the course, we sought to explore a range of technical, social, and cultural issues related to the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI). We read <a href="Section0001.xhtml#sigil_toc_id_17">several short stories about AI</a> and used the perspective granted by speculative fiction to think deeply about current trends in the technology. We explored ethical questions on artificial personhood. We thought about the use of AI in military and marketing applications. We discussed questions of justice, equity, and democracy. We questioned how machine learning systems are being used by the judiciary and the police. We approached AI in a very open minded way and sought varied contexts to explore this broadly defined technology.</p>

<p>We also spent the semester learning the <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> programming language. By the conclusion of the semester, students were able to use the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> machine learning library to train a Recursive Neural Network to generate "AI poetry" based on student selected training data. Many students chose works from <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> for the assignment, resulting in some delightful and surprising results. This collection represents the product of that work.</p>

<p>We began this semester by carrying forward some of the lessons learned from the previous year. We began with the premise that <i>AI is better understood as an ideology</i> rather than a unified or static technology. The ideology of AI assumes that computationally assisted decision making is always better. The ideology of AI seeks to remove human intuition and slower, critical practices that can synthesize many sources of information in surprising ways. The ideology of AI tries to mask the bias in predictive models as they seek to intercede in human experience. We found many reasons to question the ideology of AI; in doing so, we frequently compared human cognition with computational processing by thinking about the qualities of existence, agency, and becoming in humans and machines.</p>

<p>As students, we sought to understand how essay writing represents a valuable training process for human thought. While we understood how neural networks require training data and testing data to evaluate the accuracy of something like a language model, we returned to the practice of close reading and interpretation with a new urgency. We gained a new appreciation for the purpose of the essay, an all too common genre for university students regardless of discipline. The essay was reapprehended as a tool for generating new ideas, wherein misteps in logic or fact represent opportunities to retrench our commitment to rigour and evidence. We learned that human cognition, like machine processing, requires training, testing, and an opportunity to make mistakes and learn from them.</p>

<p>For this reason, we worked slowly to craft a single essay during the course of this semester. In opposition to the computer programs we studied, we worked methodically to make duralble and human validated knowledge. Our essays were informed by both our technical understanding of programming and our speculative understanding of science fiction. In this way, our class represents the way that IASC seeks to blend theory and practice in exciting and unexpected ways. Please take time to enjoy just some of these exciting and unexpected results.

<p>I took the liberty of preparing the document and editing the submissions with a light hand. I have only made minor alterations to help punctuate and "line" the works as <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/learn/glossary-terms/free-verse">free verse poetry</a>. I removed occasional words that may have been repeated too often. I have also changed prepositions from time to time. Because attributing these works included so many authors (some of whom are machines), we chose to present these poems anonymously.</p>
