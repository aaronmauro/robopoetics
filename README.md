# Robo Poetics - Preface
Thank you for taking time with our poetry collection. This document is a collaborative project by the students of IASC 1F01 in the fall of 2020. This course is the introductory course for the <a href="https://brocku.ca/humanities/digital-humanities/programs/iasc/">Interactive Arts and Science</a> undergraduate major in the <a href="https://brocku.ca/humanities/digital-humanities/">Centre for Digital Humanities</a> at <a href="https://brocku.ca/">Brock University</a>. Our program is a multidisciplinary program that seeks to prepare the next generation of digital media innovators and scholars.

This iteration of the course sought to explore issues related to artificial intelligence (AI). We read several short stories about AI and used the perspective granted by speculative fiction to think deeply about current trends. We explored ethical questions on artificial personhood. We thought about the use of AI in military and marketing applications. We discussed questions of justice, equality, and democracy and AI. We questioned how machine learning systems are being used by the judiciary and the police. We approached AI in a very open minded way and sought varied contexts to explore this broadly defined technology.

We also spent the semester learning the <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> programming language. By the conclusion of the semester, students were able to use the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> machine learning library to train a Recursive Neural Network to generate "AI poetry" based on student selected training data. Many students chose works from <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> for the assignment, resulting in some delightful and surprising results. Because there are so many technologies used to make "AI" and the contexts for their use are so complex, we learned that <i>AI is equal parts technology and ideology</i>. We exposed a distinct ideology of AI that presumes augmented human decision making is better. We hope that the quality of these poems can work to confirm or contradict this claim for our readers.

I took the liberty of preparing the document and editing the submissions with a light hand. I have only made minor alterations to help punctuate and "line" the works as free verse poetry. I removed occasional words that may have been repeated too often. I have also changed prepositions from time to time. Because attributing these works included so many authors (some of whom are machines), we chose to present these poems anonymously.
